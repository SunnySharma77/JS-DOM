📂 Folder / File Structure:

/number-color-coder/
│
├── index.html   (Main HTML File with embedded CSS and JS)
└── (No external JS or CSS for simplicity)

🧠 Core Logic / Flow:
A <div> container is created in HTML.
Using a for loop (1 to 100), numbers are dynamically generated.
For each number:
It is checked if it's a prime number.
If prime → red background.
Else if even → green background.
Else → yellow background.
Each number is added to the container using appendChild.
Styled with Flexbox for responsive wrapping.

Project Status:
✔️ Completed — Fully functional with clean and minimal design
